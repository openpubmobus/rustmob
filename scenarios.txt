TODO:
  x hash the machine id
  + take a time argument
  + Try to start twice from the same machine?
  + config cli to give a warning if run without a command
  - Should we delete a timer when it's done
  + take care of trying to join a non-existant id
  - human test for multiple timers
  - pull integration test out of main.rs
  - better overall file (module) organization?
  + provide a command to print the hashed id
  - cancel timer prematurely so you can start it again (restart?)

  currently:

  - the timer can only be run once on the host machine
