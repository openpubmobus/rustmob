TODO:
  x hash the machine id
  x take a time argument
  x disallow starting timer from the same machine
  + config cli to give a warning if run without a command
  + take care of trying to join a non-existant id
  - pull integration test out of main.rs
  - better overall file (module) organization?
  x provide a command to print the hashed id
  x cancel timer prematurely so you can start it again (restart?)
  x delete UID key when attempting to join after expiration
  - delete UID key after expiration

  - human test for multiple timers


RACE conditions?

- store timer as a insert-first list
- delete all timers after the 1st when joining
- delete all timers after the 1st when creating

new jefftimer 5 at time A => [ A+5 ]
join jefftimer => [ A+5 ]
jefftimer expires => [ A+5 ]
new jefftimer 5 at time B > A =>
    step 1 insert new time [ B+5, A+5 ]
    step 2 delete all but first [ B+5 ]

- quarterly job to remove IDs not touched in past quarter?
