Earlier approach(suspended):

base case

Alpha joins the timer:
    - a tag is created time_marker-expiration_time_in_UTC-userid
    - There is no timer running => start new timer
    - push time_marker.txt with:
        - when timer is up (in UTC), X minutes from now
        - git user ID
    - it kicks off a thread on my machine for X minutes
    - when complete it triggers the "mob next" function
    - mob next:
        - announces done

Beta joins the timer
    - 

Firebase approach(currently in works):

Base case:

1. Alpha runs a command to start the mob timer -> rustmob start 5
    a. A call is made to firebase to save the current timestamp and end timestamp against a unique identifier
    b. Program starts a local timer
2. Alpha gets the unique id as a return value
3. Alpha shares the unique id with the group
4. Beta fires up a command with the unique id 
    a. The program fetches the timestamp from firebase
    b. The program starts a local timer
5. Once timers are finished, program beeps
